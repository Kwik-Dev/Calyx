    /// The `X-Calyx-Surface-ID` header value itself is
    /// `${CALYX_SESSION_ID:-$CALYX_SURFACE_ID}`: a persistent-session
    /// pane's calyx-session ID survives ghostty surface re-creation
    /// (reconnect) while `CALYX_SURFACE_ID` does not, so `CALYX_SESSION_ID`
    /// is preferred whenever set, falling back to the ordinary
    /// `CALYX_SURFACE_ID` otherwise. The fail-open guard above checks
    /// both variables (not just `CALYX_SURFACE_ID`) so a hypothetical
    /// future caller that sets only `CALYX_SESSION_ID` still gets its
    /// event forwarded, rather than the guard silently depending on an
    /// invariant ("`CALYX_SESSION_ID` is only ever set alongside
    /// `CALYX_SURFACE_ID`") that happens to hold today but isn't
    /// enforced anywhere.
    ///
    /// Second fail-open guard, herdr environment contamination: running
    /// a herdr server from inside a Calyx pane's shell means every
    /// shell herdr itself spawns can inherit that pane's
    /// `CALYX_SURFACE_ID`/`CALYX_SESSION_ID` — the guard above alone
    /// does NOT catch this, because that inherited ID is non-empty
    /// (just stale/misattributed, not unset). The guard is
    /// `[ -n "$HERDR_PANE_ID" ]`: of every `HERDR_`-prefixed variable
    /// herdr sets inside a managed pane (`HERDR_PANE_ID`,
    /// `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`, `HERDR_TAB_ID`, `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`,
    /// `HERDR_ENV`, empirically confirmed against a real herdr pane),
    /// only `HERDR_PANE_ID` reliably means "this shell is running
    /// inside a herdr-managed pane". The others are not that signal —
    /// `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` in particular is user-facing configuration a
    /// person may export in their own shell profile (to select a herdr
    /// session by default) from inside an ORDINARY Calyx pane herdr
    /// never touched at all, so a guard that suppressed on ANY
    /// `HERDR_`-prefixed name would silently cost that pane its agent
    /// monitoring the moment the user exports it. An earlier
    /// implementation matched any `HERDR_`-prefixed variable NAME via
    /// `awk`'s `ENVIRON` keys for exactly this over-broad reason and
    /// was replaced. Reading `$HERDR_PANE_ID` directly, rather than
    /// scanning the environment for a name/value match, also sidesteps
    /// the class of problem a text-based `env | grep` scan would have:
    /// an unrelated variable's VALUE can never be misread as its own
    /// `HERDR_PANE_ID=...` assignment, since this guard never inspects
    /// any value other than that one named parameter's own.
    ///
    /// Known residual path (tracked, not closable by this guard):
    /// Claude Code's own MCP client config (`ClaudeConfigManager`)
    /// writes the `X-Calyx-Surface-ID` header as the literal string
    /// `${CALYX_SURFACE_ID:-}`, which Claude Code itself expands from
    /// its OWN process environment at MCP-connection time, entirely
    /// inside the agent binary — a separate code path this hook script
    /// never runs in and cannot intercept. A stale `CALYX_SURFACE_ID`
    /// inherited by a herdr-managed shell can still reach that header
    /// this way. Tracked for the herdr socket-integration stage.
